      I have recently joined Huawei Technologies Research &
      Development as a researcher. I am working
      with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AE5suDoAAAAJ&hl=en">Haitham
      Bou-Ammar</a> at the intersection of robotics and machine
      learning.
    </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify">
	Previously, I was a Research Associate at King's College
	London, and worked in
	the <a href="https://rvim.online">Robotics and
	  Vision in Medicine Lab</a>,
	with <a href="https://rvim.online/author/christos-bergeles/">Prof
	  Christos Bergeles</a>, and the <a href="https://cai4cai.ml">Contextual
	  Artificial Intelligence
	  for Computer Assisted
	  Interventions Group</a>,
	with <a href="https://cai4cai.ml/author/tom-vercauteren/">Prof
	  Tom Vercauteren</a>. During my time at King's, my research focused on
	robotic surgery, human-robot interaction,
	imitation learning, and shared autonomy. I also collaborated
	on the <a href="https://h2020faros.eu">EU FAROS
	  project</a> for surgical robot applications in
	Orthopedic and Neurosurgery.
	</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify">
	During the spring of 2023, I joined the <a href="https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/ras/people">Robot-Assisted Surgery Group</a> at KU Leuven, Belgium as a Visiting Scholar hosted by <a href="https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/ras/people/00035122">Prof Emmanuel Vander Poorten</a>.
	Following this, I spent the summer in the <a href="https://rocs.balgrist.ch">Research in Orthopedic Computer Science</a> group at Balgrist University Hospital, Switzerland hosted by <a href="https://rocs.balgrist.ch/en/about-us/prof-dr-philipp-fuernstahl">Prof. Dr. Philipp FÃ¼rnstahl</a>.
	During these visiting positions, I developed automated approaches for a dual-arm robot engaged in endoscopic lumbar discectomy.
	These methods were tested on cadaver specimens during my stay in Zurich.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify">
	I was a post-doc at the University of
	Edinburgh in
	the <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/slmc">Statistical
	  Machine Learning and Motor Control Group</a>
	with <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/svijayak/">Prof
	  Sethu Vijayakumar</a>, and collaborated on
	the <a href="https://harmony-eu.org/">EU HARMONY
	  project</a> for assistive robots in healthcare and
	also on smart factory projects
	with <a href="https://www.kawadarobot.co.jp/product/index_en.html">Kawada
	  Robotics</a>, Japan. I was
	also <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-associates/christopher-mower">affliated
	  with The Alan Turing Institute</a>.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify"> I hold a PhD in Informatics from the
	University of Edinburgh, supervised
	by <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/svijayak/">Prof
	  Sethu Vijayakumar</a> and funded by an iCASE
	studentship
	from <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/">UKRI-EPSRC</a>
	and the <a href="https://www.costain.com/">Costain
	  Group</a>. My PhD focused on shared autonomy for
	robotics motivated by problems in the construction
	sector.
      </p>


      <p style="text-align: justify">In the past, I spent time as a numerical
	software developer intern at
	the <a href="https://www.nag.com/">Numerical
	  Algorithms Group</a>, where I developed and
	implemented methods for restoring correlation
	matrices for applications in portfolio analysis
	and finance. The code I implemented was included
	in the Mark 25 NAG Library (available in FORTRAN,
	C, and MATLAB).  The project and my masters
	dissertation was supervised by
	<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0iUe3JcAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr Craig Lucas</a> and
	<a href="https://nhigham.com/">Prof Nicholas J. Higham FRS</a>.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify">I hold two master's degrees: MSc
	Computing (Visual Information Processing) from
	Imperial College London and MSc Applied
	Mathematics with Numerical Analysis from the
	University of Manchester. I also hold a BSc in
	Mathematics from the University of Sheffield.
