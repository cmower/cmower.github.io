Reliable contact simulation plays a key role in the development of
(semi-)autonomous robots, especially when dealing with contact-rich
manipulation scenarios, an active robotics research topic. Besides
simulation, components such as sensing, perception, data collection,
robot hardware control, human interfaces, etc. are all key enablers
towards applying machine learning algorithms or model-based approaches
in real world systems. However, there is a lack of software connecting
reliable contact simulation with the larger robotics ecosystem
(i.e. ROS, Orocos), for a more seamless application of novel
approaches, found in the literature, to existing robotic hardware. In
this paper, we present the ROS-PyBullet Interface, a framework that
provides a bridge between the reliable contact/impact simulator
PyBullet and the Robot Operating System (ROS). Furthermore, we provide
additional utilities for facilitating Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in
the simulated environment. We also present several use-cases that
highlight the capabilities and usefulness of our framework. Please

supplementary material.
