This work presents a fully integrated system for reliable grasping and
manipulation using dense visual mapping, collision-free motion
planning, and shared autonomy. The particular motion sequences are
composed automatically based on high-level objectives provided by a
human operator, with continuous scene monitoring during execution
automatically detecting and adapting to dynamic changes of the
environment. The system is able to automatically recover from a
variety of disturbances and fall back to the operator if stuck or if
it cannot otherwise guarantee safety. Furthermore, the operator can
take control at any time and then resume autonomous operation. Our
system is flexible to be adapted to new robotic systems, and we
demonstrate our work on two real-world platforms - fixed and floating
base - in shared workspace scenarios. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is also the first to employ the inverse Dynamic Reachability
Map for real-time, optimized mobile base positioning to maximize
workspace manipulability reducing cycle time and increasing planning
and autonomy robustness.
